# FizzBuzz in Ruby

"*Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiple of three print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".*"

Steps
1. For this, we need a *For* loop which iterates from 1 to 100.
2. Within the loop, we set a variable, *output*. It defaults to the value of *i*.
3. If *i* is divisible by 3, set *output* to "Fizz".
4. If *i* is divisible by 5, set *output* to "Buzz".
5. If *i* is divisible by 3 *and* 5, set *output* to "FizzBuzz".
6. Print *output*.
